Amber Drupal module
=================
Amber keeps links working on blogs and websites.

Whether links fail because of DDoS attacks, censorship, or just plain old link rot, reliably accessing linked content is a problem for Internet users everywhere. The more routes we provide to information, the more all people can freely share that information, even in the face of filtering or blockages. Amber adds to these routes.

## Installation ##

To install Amber, you must download the module from the Drupal module directory: https://www.drupal.org/project/amber. We exclusively use the Drupal.org infrastructure for module development, versioning, and issue tracking. The code in this Github repo is not necessarily up-to-date with the code on Drupal.org.

Full installation instructions, as well as a guide for configurations and settings, can be found on our Wiki: https://github.com/berkmancenter/amber_drupal/wiki
